Summary

To start using Goldcoin, you’ll need a wallet. A wallet is just like your online bank account, only your entire account is stored securely on your local computer or Android device. From your wallet you can send and receive Goldcoin, manage your address book and review a history of your transactions.

Gold Coin (GLD) is a Scrypt based P2p digital currency which means you can most likely use the video card in your computer to mine them, Goldcoin is a litecoin clone with 123,423,900 Total GLD and 26,325,000 Total Blocks(not final). Currently, mining Goldcoin with a traditional computer and GPU is not profitable, you need called "Scrypt-ASIC" this is special hardware,which is developed for this Algorithm.

With large vibrant support through the "Workforce" a special Team (10 people is the current goal) which is paid through a Payroll in BTC, weekly 10$. The Goldcoin Community and an extremely devoted development team, GoldCoin is the Gold Standard of Digital Currency.

Coin Generation: Our generation rules condense the entire history of gold from the beginning to the end when Earth's finite supply is finally exhausted into a scaled and practical 100-year model making them both limited finite resources.

    The default ports are 8121 (connect) and 8122 (fson rpc) 

    A great name meaning "value" to billions of people Worldwide. 

    Total Blocks: Block Reward ends in year 2113, transaction fees still apply. 

    Now compatible with android devices! Our client is compatible with mobile devices that run the android operating system. Now you can take your Goldcoins on the road! 

    GoldCoin is faster than both BTC and LTC in terms of confirmation times and features an innovative 51% attack defense system. 

    Unique and innovative 51% attack defense system. 

    Newly developed difficulty algorithm "Golden River." Faster difficulty adjustment time for each block. - more information will follow... 

    Coin generation rules modeled after physical gold. 

    Gradual reduction in block reward creating diminishing coin supply. 

Golden River

Golden River apart from KGW, KGW, DS, etc.


DGW/KGW and their variants use something akin to a weighted moving average to determine the difficulty. Whereas Golden River uses median and average times in accordance with various pre-defined clauses in step cases to provide near-best case movement without a pre-determined curve.

The result is that while KGW and their variants are prettier to look at in their implementation, Golden River vastly outperforms them in cases where the difficulty needs to drop quickly. With Golden River the network difficulty can fall ~42% in a single block and still be accurate, in terms of the targeted block times, to the network hash rate. KGW and their variants perform something similar in function(they take much longer).. but they are vulnerable to certain types of attacks(namely time warp attacks). Furthermore those algorithms typically over-adjust upwards leading to network slow down, whereas Golden River is on the spot with these changes.

The calculation with Golden River uses the median of the last 60 blocks and the average of the last 120 blocks for its final value. It is extremely robust as a method, and in fringe cases where the network is under attack KGW may slow down for ~20 blocks, but Golden River will only slow down for a 1-3 blocks, before returning to normal block time value calculation. The type of attack GoldCoin was facing earlier(90% hash-power difficulty increasing attack) would be solved in a day with KGW at work.. with Golden River, It'd be solved in a few hours at most. With KGW at work, the network block solving times would be consistently 1000% or more above target while the attack was going on.. with Golden River the block times would be on the mark for more than 80% of the time while the attack was going on with only occasional slow downs that compare to normal KGW at work..

Furthermore what is outstanding about Golden River is that the difficulty can still rise as fast as it used to with the previous algorithm.. There is no tangible benefit for anyone to flip their hash power on and off with GoldCoin because of our 51% defense.. but the latest attack was not profit motivated.. Rather the miners sought to cause us trouble whenever they could at their own expense. Initially our 51% defense warded off the multi-pools.. but these particular miners seem to be here to effectively DDOS the network difficulty algorithm.. but Golden River will stop them in their tracks. No other coin can claim to have 90% of their hash power flipped on and off like this and still survive.. and after Golden River.. even such a drastic change which even the "best" alt-coins out there cannot handle.. will be an easy task for GoldCoin.

We are truly building the Gold Standard of Crypto-currency here, we may take our time, but we build the best. I hope this answers your viewer's question.

A simpler explanation would be:

Golden River is faster to adapt, and more secure than KGW and their variants, and along with the 51% defense enables us to be a true POW coin thus sticking to Satoshi's original vision.

On the Goldcoin Block explorer you can see that the difficulty is adjusting for each Block:

Open Workforce

Introducing the GoldCoin (GLD) Open Workforce Project™


Overview:

One of the main problems facing digital currency is the lack of incentive for community members to remain involved. To solve this problem and to attract and reward those individuals that would like to contribute, I have created the GoldCoin Open Workforce Project.

This project will help GoldCoin in a number of ways by bringing utility to GLD, increasing trade volume, attracting new talent, growing the community, and adding another unique characteristic to our already very special brand. It also allows those without the resources to acquire costly rigs, to mine Goldcoin like people have mined precious metals for decades - by providing labor with their very own hands.

Salary/Payments:

Each worker is guaranteed to earn a minimum of $40.00/month. The appointed paymaster (currently me) will be responsible for checking worker outpost threads each Friday, verifying POW, and submitting worker payments in GoldCoin.

Proof of Work:

To be eligible for Friday payday, you must simply provide POW in your outpost thread for that week. We require a minimum of 2 outpost updates to be eligible for that week's payment. You are mining gold the old fashioned way, with your hands. Provide a fair week's work and receive a fair week's pay.

Slack Team:

All active workers will be invited to Slack and provided with full access to the team and its channels.The slack team is for active workers only. An active worker is someone that has been eligible for payroll at least one week during the previous 30 days.

https://goldworkers.slack.com

Open Skype:

Goldcoin is an real Community Coin and if you want to be part of the actual process then you can speak to the Goldcoin Community via Skype. In order to make Community agreements over Goldcoin related Content and forthcoming goals and decisions.

Available Positions:

A list of filled and open positions will be under this Post. This is where community members can monitor openings and the names of active workers. If a worker goes 'radio silent' for more than 30 days, he will be defined as inactive and his position will become open and available. The Workers thread will be moved to the retired workers. If a worker wants to be active again then we can reactivate the workers account. This guarantees an enthusiastic goldcoin group wich pushes the actual Community goals to serve Goldcoin.

How to Get Started:

If you are interested in participating, please reply in this thread listing the skills you can bring to the table and position desired. Everyone that applies will be accepted regardless of sex, race, experience, or nationality. The only requirements are that you provide weekly POW, be community/team oriented, and continuously strive for GoldCoin's greatest good.

Current Member Goals:

Will be organized currently with Trello and Slack and gldtalk.org.
