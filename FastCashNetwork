[size=17pt][b]What is FastCash?[/b][/size]

[size=12pt]FastCash is a digital currency launched and distributed by airdrop for 12 hours on August 26, 2016. During the airdrop, the coin was met with unprecedented community demand, and ran out before the 12 hour timer ended. FastCash is a token that will be used on the FastNetwork decentralized service marketplace as a medium of exchange for basic network tasks. It remains as an inflation vehicle on the main network, accruing around 100% interest per annum. It also is the collateral currency that will be required to run a node on the FastNetwork. FastCash has a low initial supply of 780,000 coins.

[size=17pt][b]What is the FastNetwork?[/b][/size]

[size=12pt]The FastNetwork ecosystem is a parallel secondary network to the main FastCash network. This system will initially be built with a few functions that will allow it to serve as a very basic decentralized service marketplace with a backing node network allowing all functions to be performed with no central server or entity. The decentralized service marketplace will allow basic network tasks to be bought and sold, such as hosting, exchange of digital assets, advertisement space, as well as data mining on other alternate currency networks. The main incentive for hosting nodes will be service fees accrued from active service contracts. Secondary node incentives will include Hi-PoS rewards only available to node owners, while the main network will remain at a percentage inflation. Node owners will be required to manage a set collateral of FastCash to be accepted by the main network. Upon initial release, the FastNetwork system is planned to begin with a decentralized digital asset exchange and advertising. Full details will be revealed in the whitepaper within the next 48 hours.[/size] [/font]

[size=12pt]I. Summary
The FastNetwork ecosystem is a parallel secondary network to the main FastCash network. This system will initially be built with a few functions that will allow it to serve as a very basic decentralized service marketplace with a backing node network allowing all functions to be performed with no central server or entity. The decentralized service marketplace will allow basic network tasks to be bought and sold, such as hosting, exchange of digital assets, advertisement space, as well as data mining on other alternate currency networks. The main incentive for hosting nodes will be service fees accrued from active service contracts. Secondary node incentives will include Hi-PoS rewards only available to node owners, while the main network will remain at a percentage inflation. Node owners will be required to manage a set collateral of FastCash to be accepted by the main network. Upon initial release, the FastNetwork system is planned to begin with a decentralized digital asset exchange and advertising.

II. Node network
i. Types of Nodes
There will be two types and a limited amount of nodes on the FastNetwork as the coin supply is relatively low while the collateral will be considerably high. Requirements for a network Fastnode are predicted to be at 20,000 FastCash, and a high performance VPS to handle heavy traffic. The Fastnodes will be responsible for handling instant transaction confirmations, act as a full network  node for wallet connectivity, and storing temporary data on service contracts (eg; advertisements). The second type of node is called the Marketnode, and will be responsible for various heavy tasks, mainly managing temporary ledgers and contracts for the decentralized exchange. The Marketnode will be the main distributing entity that will issue service contracts to Fastnodes based on their connectivity and performance. It will be a competitive market on the Fastnode network as higher performing nodes will be prioritized tasks over lower performance nodes. In future implementations, Marketnodes will have the core responsibility for any data mining contracts on search engines. With this, it is expected that Marketnodes will be required to operate on high-end VPS servers with a recommended 32-core processor and 448 GB of RAM, as well as a high bandwidth and network limit. As well, the collateral requirement for a Marketnode will be significantly higher, expected to be at 60,000 FCH. Wallets that wish to participate in advertising will require a minimum balance of 1,500 FCH. This is to regulate the quality of active wallets.
ii. Incentives
Node incentives will vary per type of node.
a. Fastnodes
Fastnodes will acquire 20% of Hi-PoS rewards per block. There will be 10 FastCash per Hi-PoS block. The reward of 2 FCH will be distributed to a random node per block, similar to that of a Masternode. As well as the static reward, Fastnodes will earn revenue from advertisement contracts- 30% of issued revenue will be paid systematically to all active nodes. The remaining 60% will be paid to wallets, as will  be discussed in section IV.
b. Marketnodes
Marketnodes will receive 80% of all Hi-PoS rewards, every block. Since there will be only a few Marketnodes on the network, owning one will be extremely profitable as the blocks are only divided by a low amount of nodes. Marketnodes are expected to maintain high performance at all times, and may be rejected by the network if there any connectivity issues or hardware lags. Only 10% of revenue from advertising contracts will be distributed to all active Marketnodes. However, fees earned from the decentralized exchange and data mining contracts will be distributed to the Marketnodes only. Fees from the decentralized exchange is set at 0.1% per trade. Data mining fees will be variable depending on the magnitude of the contract.
c. Active Wallets
Active Wallets will receive 60% of advertisement revenue, distributed throughout all participating wallets depending on the types of advertisement contracts issued. Hardware and network requirements are minimal, and can be hosted from a home computer.
III. Decentralized Exchange
Mechanics, features, and additional information will be available at a later date.

IV. Advertising Contracts
i. Introduction
One of the biggest features towards FastCash's mainstream adoption will be the FastNetwork's advertisement revenue sharing system. As well as all network nodes, any participating FastCash wallet will be able to earn a portion of advertisement fees. The global ad market is growing at an incredible pace, with $180.8B USD spent on advertising in the USA alone in 2014, according to Statista1. FastNetwork will harness this expansion by introducing a new peer-to-peer advertising system that will allow businesses to advertisement to potential clients through a decentralized intermediary- managed and upheld by the FastNetwork.
ii. Mechanics
Businesses will be able to enter their general information and advertisement media through the wallet interface, as well as a bid in FCH to claim advertisement slots. Once entered, the business will be added to an auction-style ledger where the highest-bidding bidders will be able to distribute their media to all participating wallets. Multiple businesses will be able to participate at once, depending on the number of active wallets. To become an active wallet, clients will need to enter their details for various social media sites, such as Twitter and Facebook. Website advertisement will be added at a later date. From there, select Fastnodes will communicate with the API of the social media sites, posting media content distributed by the businesses on the behalf of the clients. Revenue will be distributed after every post, calculated from the number of posts made and the amount the business paid at the beginning. Advertisement media will be stored on all active Fastnodes. Once the advertisement contract ends, the media will be deleted and will have to be re-uploaded to the FastNetwork by the business with a new contract.
iii. Targetted advertising
Targetted advertising will only be able to be narrowed down to region. Additional measures will be looked into the future to enhance the targetting scope. Businesses will be able to target clients by region. For example, if a business wishes to target residents in Hong Kong, the network would parse the IPs of all active wallets and distribute media to the social media accounts associated with the wallets.

V. Data Mining
i. Introduction
Data mining is an increasingly popular means of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of big businesses. For example, if a business wanted to know which group of products are most frequently purchased together, they'd hire a data mining firm to parse search engines, databases, and websites for information and provide an analyzed summary of the most frequent combinations. The FastNetwork will perform similar tasks, but on a grander, network scale.
ii. Mechanics
There are various processes in the science of data mining. The actual step of mining the data is small in the large scheme of things. In the beginning, the FastNetwork will handle 3 specific types of data mining tasks: Market basket analysis, Summarization, and Regression Analysis. Depending on the load of the task, work may be distributed to Fastnodes.
a. Market Basket Analysis
This will task the FastNetwork with parsing search engines for relationships between and upto 3 variables provided by the business.The finalized data dump will be a .dat file that will be found in the roaming directory of FastCash of the paying business. Unfortunately, specific interpretation and evaluation won't be available for the finalized data, and the .dat file will have to be reviewed and validated by other firms.
b. Summarization
This will task the FastNetwork with compacting and reanalyzing data provided and uploaded by the business. The raw data provided may be up to a few TB, and will be temporarily stored on Marketnodes until the task is completed. The business will be required to provide up to 3 variables that need to be analyzed. The resulting data dump will be small .dat file providing visualization of the set of provided data on a much smaller scale.
c. Regression Analysis
This will task the FastNetwork with running numerous generated algorithms to create a proper function that accurately models data, uploaded by the business. The resulting data dump will be a small .dat file with at least 5 functions that correlate with the provided data.

VI. Conclusion
With all of the plans in the Proof-of-Concept, the FastNetwork may become one of the biggest service networks on the internet. The starting services provided by the FastNetwork were carefully chosen as they are one of the biggest and fastest growing industries in the world. As with all cryptocurrency projects, the FastNetwork project is not guaranteed to work or be completed. There will be numerous technical boundaries that will be uncovered in the process of creating the biggest cryptocurrency network. Any investment made in the FastNetwork or its subsidaries should be considered extremely high risk.
