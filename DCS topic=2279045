F.A.Q. and troubleshoot

  How do I add nodes?
   1. You must download the wallet, open it and then close it.
   2. Go to your %appdata% folder (just type %appdata% into the Windows Explorer address bar)(/home/username/.dicestake/dicestake.conf for Linux)
   2. Create file called dicestake.conf
   4. Open the dicestake.conf file with Notepad and copy&paste the nodes(below) into the file.
Code:

addnode=24.70.209.174
addnode=58.96.48.184
addnode=89.152.239.137
addnode=185.223.30.231
addnode=124.103.166.94
addnode=83.157.62.179
addnode=88.115.99.24
addnode=87.219.23.161
addnode=176.159.112.85
addnode=51.15.211.40
addnode=114.35.115.104
addnode=37.110.6.59
addnode=73.120.52.248
addnode=49.244.219.9
addnode=165.227.79.172

  5. Again start the wallet and wait for it to be synced.
