Ever wish you could show your appreciation to someone in a big way? Now you can! Honey is a cryptocurrency made specifically for use as a token of appreciation.
Honey has a low supply cap to ensure that HONEY coins are only passed out on occasions where someone has genuinely been helped out.

Daemon Features:
-Cookie Authentication
   - There is no need for the rpcuser/password parameters in honey.conf to run the daemon.
   - They can still be defined, but if not, an authentication cookie file will be generated in the 
     .honey directory and deleted on shutdown. So one less step to take to run a headless node for staking.
     Example setup for honey.conf is:

    [code]
    listen=1
    server=1
    daemon=1
    port=7799
    rpcport=9977
    rpcconnect=127.0.0.1
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    [/code]

    For a headless staking node:
    [code]daemon=1[/code]

QT GUI Wallet Features:
-Integrated block explorer
-Two themes, default light theme and an optional dark theme
-More features to come
