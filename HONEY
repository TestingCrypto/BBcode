Daemon Features:
-Cookie Authentication
   - There is no need for the rpcuser/password parameters in honey.conf to run the daemon.
    For a headless staking node all you need is:
    [code]daemon=1[/code]

   - They can still be defined, but if not, an authentication cookie file will be generated in the 
     .honey directory and deleted on shutdown. So one less step to take to run a headless node for staking.
     Example setup for honey.conf is:

    [code]
    listen=1
    server=1
    daemon=1
    port=7799
    rpcport=9977
    rpcconnect=127.0.0.1
    rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
    [/code]

QT GUI Wallet Features:
-Integrated block explorer
-Two themes, default light theme and an optional dark theme
-More features to come
